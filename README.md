I used CourseAssist to tutor me on how to build a makefile
I used DeepSeek to show me how to develop the EditDistance and Split functions as I was unsure on how to develop them
The rest of the code I used ChatGPT to give me an ideas on how to approach each problem depending on if I needed help or not.
